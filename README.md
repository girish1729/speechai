Speech recognition and voice synthesis stub
===========================================

This project attempts to demonstrate how easy it can be 
 to do voice recognition and voice synthesis using any webkit
enabled browser. At the moment though this does work on Firefox
though it is based on webkit, but things will change soon.

Overview
========

Using a simple Angular.js module I demonstrate how 
 simple it is to talk to an express server to return
 an answer for a given question and how the user
 can simply talk and listen.

There is also a server  to simulate an AI replying automaton.

You could simply build a lookup table of strings and return something
based on a pattern match. Possibilities are endless of course.
